Description = "He's the renegade artist that has lived life on his own terms and made art free of sophistication and pretense, but packed with life and 'low brow' ethos. Part of the group that founded Zap Comics in the late 1960's, one time artist for Ed 'Big Daddy' Roth, and the founder of Juxtapoz magazine. While it was assured that he'd never be part of the established art world, by 2010, his skill and body of work got him into the prestigious Whitney Biennial. It's a great honor and fun moment to speak with Robert Williams"
